This project was created to better understand the CNN blocks, their forward and backward pass.
The idea was taken from practical assignments to Dr. Andrew Ng's Convolutional Neural Nets course.

Project includes following implementations:
  
  - Convolution2D, Maxpooling2D, Dense, Flatten layers 
  - Binary and Categorical Cross Entropy functions 
  - ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions
  - Mini Batch stochastic gradient descent optimizer
